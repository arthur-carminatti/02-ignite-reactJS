# Timer

<h2>Project Description</h2>

Welcome to the "Timer" project, part of the 'Ignite' course by Rocketseat. In this project, we utilized ReactJS with TypeScript, leveraging Vite for a swift project setup. The Timer project aims to provide a simple yet effective countdown timer for users to utilize.

With the Timer app, users can select the desired time duration and provide a description for the specific use of the timer. Additionally, users will be able to view the history of previously created timers, offering better insights into their time management habits.
